# NINA XMPP bot

XMPP bot that sends messages from the German NINA official warning app.

Checks the official JSON files every once in a while (configurable in the config
file) for changes and sends new warnings to registered users based on the
coordinates the entered.

## Install

(tested on Linux Mint 20.2)

1. Install dependencies

       sudo apt install libsqlite3-mod-spatialite

2. Install nina_xmpp

       pip3 install git+https://github.com/jplitza/nina_xmpp.git

   Alternatively with user only privileges:

       pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/jplitza/nina_xmpp.git

3. Configure config.yml

       wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplitza/nina_xmpp/master/config.sample.yml -O config.yml

   Open config.yml in your favourite text editor and adapt to your needs, i.e. provide XMPP credentials and admin contact

4. Run

       nina_xmpp config.yml

   Logging can be configured via the `--log-level <LOG_LEVEL>` argument  with `INFO` being the default if not specified.

   You can use my systemd unit file in `nina-xmpp.service` as a starting point if you want to run it on a server.

## Usage

Chat with the JID specified in the config to register yourself for warnings:

```
< help
> register
>     Register to messages regarding a coordinate
> unregister
>     Unregister from messages regarding a coordinate
> list
>     List active registrations
> help
>     Show available commands

< list
> No active registrations.

< register 52.51704, 13.38792
> Successfully registered to coordinates 52.51704, 13.38792
```

Now you will receive warnings for the center of Berlin when they happen.

You can register to multiple coordinates.
