  Thanks for your first coordinate registration!
  By using this service, you accept that I, the service operator ({owner_jid}), store the coordinates that you register (rounded to {coordinate_digits} decimal places) along with your JID, until you unregister them.
  As soon as you send the command "unregister all", I will delete everything I have stored about you.
